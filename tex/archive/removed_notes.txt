Spatio-temporal seismicity migration analysis is of interest in fluid injection induced seismicity because it provides insight into the mechanisms driving seismicity during injection activities \cite{DeBarrosEtAl2021}. Previous studies have established fluid overpressure as a classical mechanism of induced seismicity. According to the Mohr--Coulomb failure criterion, an increase in fluid pressure decreases the effective stress acting on a fault, which brings it closer to failure \cite{king1959role}. In fractured rock systems, the fluid injected at a given position propagates according to the diffusion law. The pressure perturbation front derived from the diffusion equation propagates proportionally to the square-root-of-time, with a proportionality constant defined as the diffusivity of the medium \cite{MurphyEtAl2004}. Researchers have observed such diffusive behavior in numerous cases of fluid injection-induced seismicity migration. The seismicity front, generally defined as the nearly farthest extent of seismicity at a given time \cite{DanreEtAl2024}, follows a square-root-of-time scaling at several injection sites (e.g., \citeA{ShapiroEtAl2002}), a characteristic of diffusion-controlled processes. This type of seismicity migration suggest that the injection-induced seismicity is mainly controlled by fluid overpressure and its spatio-temporal evolution.


Recently, considerable evidence has accumulated to show that seismicity migration data obtained from multiple fluid injection sites exhibit features that cannot be explained by the classical linear diffusion law (e.g. \citeA{ShapiroDinske2009, DeBarrosEtAl2021}). This observation calls into question the commonly invoked mechanisms to explain induced seismicity \cite{GeSaar2022}. Therefore, it is of interest to compile and compare the seismicity migration patterns observed at fluid injection sites worldwide. Previous studies have documented seismicity migration across multiple sites \cite{GoebelBrodsky2018,DeBarrosEtAl2021}, as well as at individual sites \cite{ShapiroEtAl2002,LenglineEtAl2017,DanreEtAl2024}. Notably, these studies examined the spatio-temporal evolution of the seismicity front and searched for a power-law relationship in time that best fits its evolution. For conciseness, we refer to this power-law relationship describing the evolution of the seismicity front as the seismicity migration model. Table~\ref{tab:migration-observations} summarizes the migration models and the exponents of time reported for several injection sites in the literature. The table shows that the evolution of seismicity front varies across injection sites and among different studies. The inferred time exponents range from approximately 1/3 to 1.

The inferred time exponents range from approximately 1/3 to 1. Additionally, seismic activity at some injection sites lack observable migration behavior. The classical and commonly used power-law relationship to describe the evolution of the seismic front is the square-root relationship \cite{ShapiroEtAl1997, ShapiroEtAl2002}.

However , the seismicity migration data show that, at numerous injection sites,the evolution of the seismicity front deviates from square-root-of-time (diffusion) scaling. In addition to the square-root-of-time scaling, three other seismicity migration behaviors exist: sub-1/2 time exponent, quasi-linear or linear, and no migration (see Table~\ref{tab:migration-observations}). Researchers have proposed several mechanisms associated with fluid-induced seismicity that explain these departures from diffusive ($\sqrt{t}$) scaling. These mechanisms include aseismic slip, poroelastic effects, nonlinear pressure diffusion, and Coulomb stress transfer (Table~\ref{tab:induced-seismicity-mechanisms}). In the following, we briefly review the mechanisms that previous studies propose to explain each observed seismicity migration behavior.

In addition to the diffusive migration of seimicity, observations from several injection-induced seismicity sequences show that earthquakes can occur at distances well beyond the region of elevated fluid pressure and, in some cases, without a clear migrational pattern \cite{GoebelBrodsky2018}. In particular, \citeA{GoebelEtAl2017} documented seismic events triggered far from the injection zone during wastewater disposal in Oklahoma, USA\@. Numerical analyses of these sequences indicate that stress perturbations extend beyond the fluid pressure front and dominate the far-field response. Based on such observations, \cite{GoebelBrodsky2018} suggest that injection-induced seismicity sequences lacking observable migration (Table~\ref{tab:migration-observations}) may result from far-reaching poroelastic stress changes.

These observations demonstrate the influence of nonlinear diffusion on induced seismicity migration and seismic event density, and they highlight fracture opening as the dominant mechanism controlling fluid injection induced seismicity.

These observations indicate seismicity migration following cubic root scaling is the signature of nonlinear diffusion, but square root may also arise from nonlinear diffusion

Aseismic slip, as an additional mechanism, can explain the quasi-linear seismicity migration observed at several injection sites. However, this mechanism, along with other mechanisms discussed previously, introduce additional complexity into the problem. In particular, these mechanisms introduce extra physical parameters and governing laws that remain poorly constrained. Moreover, they require assumptions about medium properties that are not clearly justified. For example, considering aseismic slip during fluid injection requires knowledge of the fault friction law and its associated parameters, which are generally poorly known. In addition, aseismic slip as a mechanism for fluid-induced seismicity requires the fault to be initially critically stressed \cite{BhattacharyaViesca2019, DeBarrosEtAl2021}, which may not hold at some injection sites. In conclusion, although mechanisms other than fluid diffusion can explain the previously observed ``non-diffusional'' features in the data, they introduce poorly constrained variables and additional degrees of freedom into the model.

As discussed previously, nonlinear diffusion during fluid injection can alter seismicity migration behavior. Studies have examined this process primarily in the context of hydraulic fractures. Additionally, no discussion has been made on its role in the quasi-linear migration of induced seismicity sequences. Nevertheless, a semi-analytical study of nonlinear diffusion has shown that pressure diffusion in rock fractures can result in a time exponent of 4/5 \cite{MurphyEtAl2004}. In this context, we aim to use well-constrained fault physical parameters to simulate fluid injection into a deformable fault under various injection boundary conditions and to evaluate the resulting impact on seismicity migration through comparison with observations.
