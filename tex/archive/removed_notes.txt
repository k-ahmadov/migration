Spatio-temporal seismicity migration analysis is of interest in fluid injection induced seismicity because it provides insight into the mechanisms driving seismicity during injection activities \cite{DeBarrosEtAl2021}. Previous studies have established fluid overpressure as a classical mechanism of induced seismicity. According to the Mohr--Coulomb failure criterion, an increase in fluid pressure decreases the effective stress acting on a fault, which brings it closer to failure \cite{king1959role}. In fractured rock systems, the fluid injected at a given position propagates according to the diffusion law. The pressure perturbation front derived from the diffusion equation propagates proportionally to the square-root-of-time, with a proportionality constant defined as the diffusivity of the medium \cite{MurphyEtAl2004}. Researchers have observed such diffusive behavior in numerous cases of fluid injection-induced seismicity migration. The seismicity front, generally defined as the nearly farthest extent of seismicity at a given time \cite{DanreEtAl2024}, follows a square-root-of-time scaling at several injection sites (e.g., \citeA{ShapiroEtAl2002}), a characteristic of diffusion-controlled processes. This type of seismicity migration suggest that the injection-induced seismicity is mainly controlled by fluid overpressure and its spatio-temporal evolution.


Recently, considerable evidence has accumulated to show that seismicity migration data obtained from multiple fluid injection sites exhibit features that cannot be explained by the classical linear diffusion law (e.g. \citeA{ShapiroDinske2009, DeBarrosEtAl2021}). This observation calls into question the commonly invoked mechanisms to explain induced seismicity \cite{GeSaar2022}. Therefore, it is of interest to compile and compare the seismicity migration patterns observed at fluid injection sites worldwide. Previous studies have documented seismicity migration across multiple sites \cite{GoebelBrodsky2018,DeBarrosEtAl2021}, as well as at individual sites \cite{ShapiroEtAl2002,LenglineEtAl2017,DanreEtAl2024}. Notably, these studies examined the spatio-temporal evolution of the seismicity front and searched for a power-law relationship in time that best fits its evolution. For conciseness, we refer to this power-law relationship describing the evolution of the seismicity front as the seismicity migration model. Table~\ref{tab:migration-observations} summarizes the migration models and the exponents of time reported for several injection sites in the literature. The table shows that the evolution of seismicity front varies across injection sites and among different studies. The inferred time exponents range from approximately 1/3 to 1.

The inferred time exponents range from approximately 1/3 to 1. Additionally, seismic activity at some injection sites lack observable migration behavior. The classical and commonly used power-law relationship to describe the evolution of the seismic front is the square-root relationship \cite{ShapiroEtAl1997, ShapiroEtAl2002}.
