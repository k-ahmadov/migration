  abstract      = {Borehole fluid injections are common for the development of hydrocarbon and geothermic reservoirs. Often they induce numerous microearthquakes. Spatiotemporal dynamics of such induced microseismic clouds can be used to characterize reservoirs. However , a fluid-induced seismicity can be caused by a wide range of processes. Here we show that linear pore pressure relaxation and a hydraulic fracturing are two asymptotic end members of a set of non-linear diffusional phenomena responsible for seismicity triggering. To account for the whole range of processes we propose a rather general non-linear diffusional equation describing the pore pressure evolution. This equation takes into account a possibly strong enhancement of the medium permeability. Both linear pore pressure relaxation and hydraulic fracturing can be obtained as special limiting cases of this equation. From this equation we derive the triggering front of fluid induced seismicity, which is valid in the general case of non-linear pore pressure diffusion. We demonstrate corresponding seismicity signatures on different case studies.},

We investigate the case where the hydraulic transport properties are exponentially dependent on pore-fluid pressure. As a consequence, the process of pore-fluid pressure diffusion is governed by a non-linear diffusion equation. Solutions of this equation that describe fluid injection experiments are analysed and the associated microseismic signatures are explored. In particular, it is shown that this process of non-linear pore-fluid pressure diffusion allows us to define two signatures. One which is the triggering front corresponding to the triggering of microseismic events without changing the fluid transport properties significantly. The other signature is the so-called fracturing domain. It triggers the majority of microseismic events and alters the fluid transport properties significantly. Evidence for the microseismic signature of a fracturing domain at the Fenton Hill hydrofrac experiment is given.},

  abstract      = {As a rule, rock stimulation by fluid injection induces microearthquakes. Assuming that porefluid pressure diffusion is responsible for this phenomenon, one can use seismicity to estimate the hydraulic properties of rocks. Previously, for the estimation of hydraulic transport properties from the triggering front, it has been assumed that they are independent of time and pressure. However, fluid injections can strongly change permeability of rocks (e.g. hydraulic fracturing). In this paper, we investigate what kind of diffusivity estimates are provided by the triggering front in cases where hydraulic transport properties are functions of pore-fluid pressure (i.e. they are changing during the injection). In this case, the pressure relaxation results in a non-linear pore-fluid pressure diffusion associated with heterogeneously and time-dependent distributed permeability. We consider numerically two models of pressure-dependent hydraulic diffusivity, a power law and an exponential law. We generate synthetic microseismicity by solving corresponding 1-, 2- and 3-D non-linear diffusion equations. Our results show that the triggering front provides reasonable estimates of the effective diffusivity approximately corresponding to the hydraulic diffusivity resulting from the stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing) of rocks and thus constitute a significant conceptual update of the seismicity-based reservoir characterization approach.},

  abstract      = {Fluid injections into unconventional reservoirs, performed for fluid-mobility enhancement, are accompanied by microseismic activity also after the injection. Previous studies revealed that the triggering of seismic events can be effectively described by nonlinear diffusion of pore fluid pressure perturbations where the hydraulic diffusivity becomes pressure dependent. The spatiotemporal distribution of postinjection-induced microseismicity has two important features: the triggering front, corresponding to early and distant events, and the back front, representing the time-dependent spatial envelope of the growing seismic quiescence zone. Here for the first time, we describe analytically the temporal behavior of these two fronts after the injection stop in the case of nonlinear pore fluid pressure diffusion. We propose a scaling law for the fronts and show that they are sensitive to the degree of nonlinearity and to the Euclidean dimension of the dominant growth of seismicity clouds. To validate the theoretical finding, we numerically model nonlinear pore fluid pressure diffusion and generate synthetic catalogs of seismicity. Additionally, we apply the new scaling relation to several case studies of injection-induced seismicity. The derived scaling laws describe well synthetic and real data.},

However, fluid injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-fluid migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the fluid-pressurized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from fluid-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of pressurized pore fluid.},

  abstract      = {Injection-induced aseismic slip plays an important role in a broad range of human-made and natural systems, from the exploitation of geo-resources to the understanding of earthquakes. Recent studies have shed light on how aseismic slip propagates in response to continuous fluid injections. Yet much less is known about the response of faults after the injection of fluids has stopped. In this work, we investigate via a hydro-mechanical model the propagation and ultimate arrest of aseismic slip during the so-called post-injection stage. We show that after shut-in, fault slip propagates in pulse-like mode. The conditions that control the propagation as a pulse and notably when and where the ruptures arrest are fully established. In particular, critically stressed faults can host rupture pulses that propagate for several orders of magnitude the injection duration and reach up to nearly double the size of the ruptures at the moment of shut-in. We consequently argue that the persistent stressing of increasingly larger rock volumes caused by post-injection aseismic slip is a plausible mechanism for the triggering of post-injection seismicity--a critical issue in the geo-energy industry. Our physical model shows quantitative agreement with field observations of documented cases of post-injection induced seismicity.},

Here, we propose a multi-process causal mechanism for injection-induced earthquakes through a case study of the 2017 Mw 5.5 induced earthquake near Pohang Enhanced Geothermal System, Korea, where detailed hydraulic stimulation and on-site seismicity monitoring data provide an unprecedented opportunity. Pore pressure modeling reveals that pore pressure changes initiate seismicity on critically stressed faults and Coulomb static stress transfer modeling reveals that earthquake interactions promote continued seismicity, leading to larger events. On the basis of these results, we propose the following causal mechanism for induced seismicity: pore pressure increase and earthquake interactions lead to fault weakening and ultimately triggering larger earthquakes later in the process. We suggest that it is prudent that pore pressure change, initial seismicity locations, and Coulomb static stress transfer from seismicity earlier in the sequence are assessed in real-time.},

  abstract      = {Understanding the mechanical behaviour of a fractured geothermal reservoir during its operation phase, when a sustained circulation of fluid is taking place, is of crucial importance for the appraisal of this technology. This knowledge is also essential for understanding natural fault systems that exhibit fluid-induced seismicity, as the geothermal reservoir serves as a small-scale analogue to these systems. Here, we analyse the seismicity of a geothermal reservoir in France, which has been the primary target for heat exploitation over the last 8~yr. Fluid circulation in the granite has been maintained along a main fractured zone through pathways with enhanced permeability thanks to the continuous injection of fluid from a single well. We show that the seismicity occurring during the operation of this reservoir exhibits a progressive expansion outpacing the zone initially activated during the hydraulic stimulation. We also show that most recorded earthquakes are clustered in time within discrete bursts that activate different portions of the fault system. The migration of the events included in these bursts indicates that they are likely related to aseismic transients developing over the creeping fault interfaces. It therefore demonstrates that the intermittency of the seismic activity characterizing earthquake swarms can arise naturally as the complex hydro-thermo-mechanical response of a system under continuous forcing conditions.}
